The book adopts a vectors-first approach, which emphasizes the use of vector analysis and vector calculus to solve problems involving electric and magnetic fields. The book also introduces numerical methods, such as MATLAB and finite element analysis, to help students deal with complex and realistic situations. The book features worked examples in every chapter that illustrate how to apply the theory to different kinds of problems. The book also includes numerous end-of-chapter problems that test the students' understanding and reinforce their learning.
 
The sixth edition of the book, published in 2015, has been revised and updated to reflect the latest developments and trends in electromagnetism. The book now features 15 new "Application Notes" that explain the connections between concepts discussed in the text and the real world. The book also has a math assessment that enables instructors to gauge their students' mathematical knowledge and preparedness for the course. The book also covers wave polarization in Chapter 10, which is an important topic for modern communication systems.
 
The book is available in PDF format from various online sources[^3^] [^4^] [^1^]. The book is also part of the Oxford series in electrical and computer engineering, which offers a comprehensive collection of textbooks and reference books on various topics related to electrical and computer engineering.
 
Elements of Electromagnetics is a well-written, comprehensive, and rigorous textbook that covers the essential topics of electromagnetism in a clear and concise manner. The book is suitable for students who want to learn the fundamentals of electromagnetism, as well as for professionals who want to refresh their knowledge or expand their skills. The book is also a valuable resource for instructors who want to teach electromagnetism effectively and engagingly.
